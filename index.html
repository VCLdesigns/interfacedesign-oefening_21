                <h2>The Legend</h2>
                <p><span class="dropcap"> T</span>he ‘cowboy that shoots faster than his own shadow’ is like several
                    legends of the Old West all
                    rolled into one. Morris, soaked in Westerns from an early age, squeezed the best out of that genre’s
                    legendary heroes to create his own hero. Lucky Luke inherited Clarke Gable’s composure and class,
                    Gary Cooper’s ‘busted’ side, as well as his broody mien and shyness with women, all that mixed with
                    a touch of James Stewart. Yes, Lucky Luke is a cowboy, the quintessential cowboy: surrounded by an
                    aura of mystery, fearless, exemplary and staunchly lonesome. With his loyal steed Jolly Jumper, he
                    criss-crosses the American states from chance encounter to government mission. And wherever he goes,
                    he is known.
                </p>
                <p>His unparalleled skill with a revolver has made him a legend, and his fame has
                    travelled ahead of him all through the Old West. He’s also gifted with an incredible ability to
                    adapt. No matter his mission, he’ll come through with flying colours. For him, escorting a shipment
                    of gold, looking after a construction site, protecting a celebrity as they travel across a hostile
                    West … It’s all no more difficult than putting the Daltons back in prison. Just another day on the
                    job. His good and generous nature, his readiness to help, always, and above all his great humility
                    have made him the people’s darling. But in spite of the affection or admiration of his fellows, he
                    never stays long. Once his job is done, he sneaks out of the celebrations given in his honour and
                    rides into the setting sun, onward to new adventures, claiming no rewards.
                </p>
                <p>In Lucky Luke, man’s best
                    friend isn’t a dog (especially not Rin Tin Can) but his horse. Our hero views Jolly Jumper as his
                    companion more than a mere mount. Their bond dates back to early childhood, as we’re told in volume
                    Kid Lucky. With a longevity record under his gun belt (70 years and over 80 titles), Lucky Luke has
                    established himself as one of contemporary bande dessinée’s legendary figures.</p>

                    <h2>His Horse</h2>
                    <p><span class="dropcap">J</span>olly Jumper is a splendid white stallion with a golden mane.
                        Learned and proud, he’s been Lucky Luke
                        companion almost from birth. And much more than a simple mount, Jolly Jumper is above all an
                        irreplaceable partner in adventuring. Cheeky and sarcastic, he’s very adept at roasting any
                        silly
                        person that crosses his path and earns his scorn – even when that someone is his own cowboy.</p>

                    <h2>His Dog</h2>
                    <p><span class="dropcap"> R</span>in Tin Can appeared in 1960 in the pages of Sur la Piste des
                        Daltons (On the Daltons’ Trail). His
                        original name, Ran-Tan-Plan, was already a reference to Rin-Tin-Tin, the canine star of both TV
                        series and films born in 1954 in the United States. But the concept behind him was quite
                        different:
                        to show in the comics series a dog as dumb as Rin-Tin-Tin could be smart on screen!</p>

                        <p>
                            The Daltons all look remarkably alike: protruding chin, big nose, short brow and striped
                            clothes.
                            Joe is by far the nastiest of them. Pigheaded and as aggressive as a pitbull, his mind never
                            strays
                            far from his two obsessions: robbing banks and shooting Lucky Luke. Rather a tall order for
                            him…

                        <p>Jack, along with William, is one of the only two capable of a smidgeon of intelligence – or
                            at
                            least of flashes of common sense. But his devotion to Joe tends to cancel out his lucidity.
                            William and Jack don’t work without the other. In a way, they’re the duo within the quartet.
                            As
                            a matter of fact, few people really know which one is the tall one (William), which is the
                            small
                            one (Jack). They mostly serve as foils for the other two.</p>

                    <p>Averell may be the tallest, but he’s also without a doubt the dumbest of them all, and his
                        brothers spend a lot of their time telling him to shut up. His first and only concern is food.
                        His signature line, “When do we eat?” has become very popular.</p>
